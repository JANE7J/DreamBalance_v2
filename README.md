# 🌙 DreamBalance

**DreamBalance** is a web-based AI-powered dream journaling application designed to help users understand their mental and emotional state through reflective dream analysis. By combining regular dream logging with AI-generated insights and visual analytics, the platform promotes mental self-awareness in a simple, non-clinical manner.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Mental well-being is often overlooked until stress and emotional imbalance begin affecting daily life. Although dreams reflect subconscious emotions, they are rarely tracked or analyzed in a structured way. Existing mental wellness tools can feel complex or clinical, creating a need for a simple and private self-awareness platform.

## 💡 Solution Overview

DreamBalance allows users to:
- Log their dreams regularly
- Reflect on emotions felt after waking up
- Receive AI-generated insights based on dream patterns
- View calm vs stressed mental state trends over time

The application focuses on **self-awareness and reflection**, not medical diagnosis or therapy.
